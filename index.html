            <p>The figure investigates the connection between the number of visual contents posted on the seriesâ€™ fandom pages and the share of female characters in the 100 most important characters. The number of visual contents is depicted in categories because the data was categorical as well (the values were given in the form of 1K, 2K, 5K etc.). All three categories contain similar number of series in both axes. The key point is that fans share more videos and more photos if the given series contains more female characters.</p>
